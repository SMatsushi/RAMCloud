// PUBLIC METHODS

/**
 * Construct a new LogIterator on a particular Log. The iterator may be used to
 * walk the entire log in order (i.e. every entry can be iterated over in the
 * order in which it was added to the log). However, this is not be particularly
 * meaningful if cleaning is enabled, since entries could have been moved within
 * the log.
 *
 * Since additional appends to the log may occur during iteration, locks have to
 * sometimes be briefly acquired when stepping between Segments (since the list
 * of active Segments may be changing). Furthermore, once the Log head is
 * reached, it is locked to avoid any modifications during iteration and not
 * unlocked until the iterator is destroyed). Locking is not done for any of the
 * closed Segments, however, as they are immutable. Finally, although cleaning
 * may occur during iteration, any cleaned segments will have been pinned (they
 * are not permitted to be reclaimed so long as any iterator exists) so as to
 * avoid any races. This effectively delays the return of any freed memory to
 * the system until all iterators are either destroyed or have finished walking
 * the entire log. (We can relax this in the future to unpin segments after all
 * iterators have passed over them).
 *
 * Locking the head once we reach it and keeping it locked until the iterator
 * has been destroyed allows the caller to ensure that once they've iterated
 * the entire log no new modifications can be made until they decide to permit
 * them again.
 *
 * Do note that running in parallel with cleaning means that the same entry may
 * be iterated over multiple times (i.e. if the cleaner has relocated it).
 *
 * \param log
 *      The log to iterate over.
 * \param lockHead
 *      When set, we will take the log's appendLock upon reaching the head.
