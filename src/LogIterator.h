/**
 * The LogIterator provides the necessary state and methods to step through an
 * entire log, entry by entry. In conjunction with the SegmentManager class, it
 * hides the complexities of dealing with a log that is in constant flux due to
 * new appends and log cleaning. This class is primarily used by the tablet
 * migration mechanism, though it could be used for many other purposes, such as
 * scrubbing memory for bit errors.
 *
 * It is important to understand that in order to deal with concurrent appends
 * and cleaning, the instantation of a LogIterator object essentially stops the
 * log from reclaiming memory due to cleaning. Furthermore, once the head log
 * segment is reached, further appends to it are paused until the iterator is
 * destroyed. It is important, therefore, that log iterators are not longer
 * lived than they need to be and especially that iteration of the head segment
 * completes quickly.
